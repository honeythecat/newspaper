##CAPSLOCKNEWSPAPER!!
by Heather Anderson

A simple Angular.js app that lets you pretend to have a newspaper. You can create beats, make up reporters (with names, employment dates, and birthdays), and after you're done making things... YOU CAN SEARCH THEM!! So go ahead and pretend you're William Randolph Hearst, then you can pretend to be the NSA and spy on your own employees!

##Setup

Download the project folder.
Run index.html in your browser.
Have fun!

##Known Bugs as of 2/27/15
None that I can find, unless ugly is a bug.

##Motivation

To practice writing Angular apps.

Note to self: Dude...you finished the basics for this app at 3:15; that's a new record. Hell, you even have time to go back and make things better. You should be pretty excited. YOU SHOULD BE SO EXCITED THAT YOU'LL ONLY THINK IN CAPS LOCK!!!!
